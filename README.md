<h1>Tigger</h1>  <h3>COMP2041 Project</h3>


Create a basic version control system using POSIX compatable shell scripts.
Tigger is used in the same way as git, only the git commands are replaced with the following:

### 
```
tigger-init
tigger-add
tigger-commit
tigger-log   
tigger-status 
tigger-branch                 
tigger-checkout 
tigger-rm
tigger-show  
```
